# Midpoint Features and Implementation Plan

## Full Feature List

The following features are planned for the Midpoint system:

### Core Repository Management
0. Pre-execution checks: ✅
   - Test for uncommitted changes ✅
   - Test for untracked files ✅
   - Test for other git problems ✅
   - Abort if any issues are found ✅

### Branch Management
1. Branch Creation: ✅
   - Create new branch from given name ✅
   - Append random numbers to branch name ✅
   - Support automatic branch naming if none provided ✅

### State Management
2. Git Hash-based States: ✅
   - Use specific git hashes as states in objectives and goals ✅
   - Each planning stage includes initial state as git hash ✅
   - System reverts to specific hash before each planning stage ✅

### Execution Flow
3. Execution Steps:
   - Create new branch for each execution step ✅
   - Commit changes at end of execution ✅
   - Track execution progress through branches ✅

### Validation
4. Validation Process:
   - Validation agent receives only final branch hash
   - Validates changes in isolation

### Planning and Rollback
5. Planning Continuation:
   - Option to continue from validated branch
   - Ability to revert to previous branch if validation fails ✅
   - Undo changes from failed execution steps ✅

### Human Supervision
6. Human-in-the-Loop Mode:
   - Wait for human interaction after each agent call
   - Provide human controls for next steps
   - Detailed logging of:
     - Agent prompts
     - Agent outputs
     - System state changes ✅
     - Git operations ✅

## Current Implementation Subgoal: Git Repository State Management ✅

### Goal ✅
Implement and validate the core git repository state management functionality that will be used by all agents.

### Success Criteria ✅
1. Branch Management: ✅
   - Create new branch with random suffix from given name ✅
   - Validate branch creation ✅
   - Handle branch naming conflicts ✅

2. State Checking: ✅
   - Detect uncommitted changes ✅
   - Detect untracked files ✅
   - Identify other git problems ✅
   - Provide clear status reports ✅

3. Hash-based State Management: ✅
   - Revert to specific git hashes ✅
   - Track current state hash ✅
   - Validate state transitions ✅

4. Commit Management: ✅
   - Create commits with messages ✅
   - Track commit hashes ✅
   - Validate commit operations ✅

### Implementation Plan ✅
1. Extend `tools.py` with new git operations: ✅
   - `check_repo_state()` - Check for uncommitted/untracked changes ✅
   - `create_branch()` - Create new branch with random suffix ✅
   - `revert_to_hash()` - Revert to specific git hash ✅
   - `create_commit()` - Create commit and return hash ✅
   - `get_current_hash()` - Get current commit hash ✅

2. Create test suite for validation: ✅
   - Unit tests for each git operation ✅
   - Integration tests for state management ✅
   - Edge case handling tests ✅

3. Create demonstration CLI tool: ✅
   - Simple interface to test operations ✅
   - Clear output formatting ✅
   - Error handling and reporting ✅

### Next Steps After This Subgoal
Once this subgoal is completed and validated, we will:
1. Integrate this functionality into the agent system
2. Implement the human supervision mode
3. Add detailed logging and interaction capabilities
4. Build the full agent orchestration system

## Current Implementation Subgoal: Agent System Integration

### Goal
Implement and validate the core agent system that will handle goal decomposition, task execution, and validation using the git repository state management functionality.

### Success Criteria
1. Goal Decomposition Agent:
   - Accept high-level goal description
   - Break down into verifiable subgoals
   - Generate execution plan with git state checkpoints
   - Validate plan feasibility

2. Task Execution Agent:
   - Execute tasks in isolated git branches
   - Track progress through commits
   - Handle task failures gracefully
   - Maintain execution state

3. Validation Agent:
   - Validate task outputs against requirements
   - Verify git state consistency
   - Generate validation reports
   - Handle validation failures

4. Agent Communication:
   - Define clear interfaces between agents
   - Implement state passing between agents
   - Handle error propagation
   - Maintain execution context

### Implementation Plan
1. Create Agent Base Classes:
   - `BaseAgent` with common functionality
   - `GoalDecomposer` for goal breakdown
   - `TaskExecutor` for task execution
   - `Validator` for output validation

2. Implement Agent Interfaces:
   - Input/output specifications
   - State management protocols
   - Error handling patterns
   - Logging requirements

3. Create Test Suite:
   - Unit tests for each agent
   - Integration tests for agent interactions
   - End-to-end workflow tests
   - Failure scenario tests

4. Build Demonstration CLI:
