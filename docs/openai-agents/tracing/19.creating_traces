Creating traces/spans

trace


trace(
    workflow_name: str,
    trace_id: str | None = None,
    group_id: str | None = None,
    metadata: dict[str, Any] | None = None,
    disabled: bool = False,
) -> Trace
Create a new trace. The trace will not be started automatically; you should either use it as a context manager (with trace(...):) or call trace.start() + trace.finish() manually.

In addition to the workflow name and optional grouping identifier, you can provide an arbitrary metadata dictionary to attach additional user-defined information to the trace.

Parameters:

Name	Type	Description	Default
workflow_name	str	The name of the logical app or workflow. For example, you might provide "code_bot" for a coding agent, or "customer_support_agent" for a customer support agent.	required
trace_id	str | None	The ID of the trace. Optional. If not provided, we will generate an ID. We recommend using util.gen_trace_id() to generate a trace ID, to guarantee that IDs are correctly formatted.	None
group_id	str | None	Optional grouping identifier to link multiple traces from the same conversation or process. For instance, you might use a chat thread ID.	None
metadata	dict[str, Any] | None	Optional dictionary of additional metadata to attach to the trace.	None
disabled	bool	If True, we will return a Trace but the Trace will not be recorded. This will not be checked if there's an existing trace and even_if_trace_running is True.	False
Returns:

Type	Description
Trace	The newly created trace object.

This span captures the details of a model generation, including the input message sequence, any generated outputs, the model name and configuration, and usage data. If you only need to capture a model response identifier, use response_span() instead.

model	str | None	The model identifier used for the generation.	None
model_config	Mapping[str, Any] | None	The model configuration (hyperparameters) used.	None
usage	dict[str, Any] | None	A dictionary of usage information (input tokens, output tokens, etc.).	None
span_id	str | None	The ID of the span. Optional. If not provided, we will generate an ID. We recommend using util.gen_span_id() to generate a span ID, to guarantee that IDs are correctly formatted.	None
parent	Trace | Span[Any] | None	The parent span or trace. If not provided, we will automatically use the current trace/span as the parent.	None
