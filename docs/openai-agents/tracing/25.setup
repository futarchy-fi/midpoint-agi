add_tracing_processor


add_tracing_processor(tracing_processor: TracingProcessor)
Add a processor to the list of processors. Each processor will receive all traces/spans.

set_processors


set_processors(processors: list[TracingProcessor])
Set the list of processors. This will replace the current list of processors.

on_trace_start


on_trace_start(trace: Trace) -> None
Called when a trace is started.

Source code in src/agents/tracing/setup.py
on_trace_end


on_trace_end(trace: Trace) -> None
Called when a trace is finished.

Source code in src/agents/tracing/setup.py
on_span_start


on_span_start(span: Span[Any]) -> None
Called when a span is started.

Source code in src/agents/tracing/setup.py
on_span_end


on_span_end(span: Span[Any]) -> None
