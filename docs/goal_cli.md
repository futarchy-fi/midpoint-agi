# Goal Management CLI

The goal management CLI provides a set of commands for managing goals and subgoals in your project. It helps you track progress, navigate between different tasks, and visualize the hierarchy of goals.

## Installation

The goal CLI is automatically installed when you install the Midpoint package:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Core Concepts

### Goal IDs
Goals are identified using a simple ID system:
- Top-level goals: `G1`, `G2`, etc.
- Subgoals: `G1-S1`, `G1-S2`, etc.
- Nested subgoals: `G1-S1-S1`, etc.

### Goal Metadata
Goal metadata is stored in `.goal` directory with JSON files named after the goal ID.

### Branch Naming
Each goal is associated with a git branch, typically named `goal-<ID>-<random_suffix>`.

## Commands

### Goal Management

#### Create a new top-level goal
```bash
goal new "Description of the goal"
```

#### Create a subgoal under a parent goal
```bash
goal sub <parent-id> "Description of the subgoal"
```

#### List all goals and subgoals
```bash
goal list
```

### State Navigation

#### Go back N commits on current branch
```bash
goal back [steps]
```
Default is 1 step if not specified.

#### Reset to a specific commit on the current branch
```bash
goal reset <commit-id>
```

#### Create a labeled checkpoint for easy navigation
```bash
goal checkpoint "Checkpoint message"
```

#### List all available checkpoints
```bash
goal checkpoints
```

### Hierarchy Navigation

#### Go to the parent goal branch
```bash
goal up
```

#### Go to a specific subgoal branch
```bash
goal down <subgoal-id>
```

#### Go to the top-level goal branch
```bash
goal root
```

#### List available subgoals for current goal
```bash
goal subs
```

### Result Incorporation

#### Mark current goal as complete
```bash
goal complete
```

#### Merge a specific subgoal into the current goal
```bash
goal merge <subgoal-id>
```

#### Show completion status of all goals
```bash
goal status
```

### Visualization Tools

#### Show visual representation of goal hierarchy
```bash
goal tree
```

#### Show timeline of goal exploration
```bash
goal history
```

#### Generate graphical visualization
```bash
goal graph
```
Requires [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) to be installed.

For detailed examples of the visualization outputs, please see the [Goal CLI Visualization Guide](goal_cli_visuals.md).

#### Convert existing hierarchical goal IDs to the new flat ID system
```bash
goal convert
```

#### Revert a goal's current state back to its initial state
```bash
goal revert <goal-id>
```
This command will reset all fields in the goal's current state to match its initial state. If the goal has any child goals or tasks, you will be prompted for confirmation before proceeding.

## Status Indicators

The goal management system uses the following status indicators:

- âœ… Complete: Goal is marked as complete
- ðŸŸ  Ready to merge: All subgoals are complete but not yet merged
- âšª Incomplete: Some subgoals are still incomplete
- ðŸ”˜ No subgoals: Goal has no subgoals

## Examples

### Create a goal hierarchy

```bash
# Create a top-level goal
goal new "Implement authentication system"
# G1 is created

# Create subgoals
goal sub G1 "Implement user registration"
# G1-S1 is created
goal sub G1 "Implement login/logout"
# G1-S2 is created
goal sub G1 "Implement password reset"
# G1-S3 is created

# Create a nested subgoal
goal sub G1-S1 "Design registration form"
# G1-S1-S1 is created
```

### Navigate the goal hierarchy

```bash
# Go to a specific subgoal
goal down G1-S1

# Go back to parent
goal up

# Go to root goal from anywhere in the hierarchy
goal root

# List available subgoals
goal subs
```

### Track progress

```bash
# Mark current goal as complete
goal complete

# Show status of all goals
goal status

# Merge a completed subgoal into its parent
goal merge G1-S1
```

### Visualize the goal hierarchy

```bash
# Show a text-based tree view
goal tree

# Show goal history
goal history

# Generate a graphical visualization (requires Graphviz)
goal graph
```

## Advanced Usage

### Checkpoints

Create checkpoints to easily navigate back to important states:

```bash
# Create a checkpoint
goal checkpoint "Before refactoring"

# List all checkpoints
goal checkpoints
```

### Conflict Resolution

When merging subgoals, if conflicts occur:

1. The system will automatically abort the merge
2. You'll need to manually resolve conflicts:
   ```bash
   git merge <subgoal-branch>
   # Resolve conflicts
   git add <resolved-files>
   git commit -m "Merge subgoal <id>"
   ```

## Tips

1. Always mark a goal as complete (`goal complete`) before merging it into its parent
2. Use checkpoints before making significant changes
3. Use `goal tree` to quickly visualize the current state of your goals
4. Use `goal graph` to generate diagrams for documentation or presentations

## Integration with Git Workflow

The goal management system is designed to work seamlessly with Git:

1. Each goal and subgoal is associated with its own branch
2. Changes for a specific goal should be made on that goal's branch
3. When a goal is complete, merge it into its parent goal's branch
4. The system preserves the full history of changes through the branch hierarchy

### Typical Workflow

1. Create a top-level goal: `goal new "Feature X"`
2. Create subgoals: `goal sub G1 "Component A"`
3. Navigate to a subgoal branch: `goal down G1-S1`
4. Make changes on the subgoal branch
5. Mark subgoal as complete: `goal complete`
6. Navigate to parent: `goal up`
7. Merge the subgoal: `goal merge G1-S1`
8. Repeat until the top-level goal is complete
