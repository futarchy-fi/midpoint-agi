# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for Midpoint, particularly focusing on the new agent memory system.

## Testing Infrastructure

### Directory Structure

- `tests/`: Contains formal unit and integration tests that run with pytest
  - `test_memory_tools.py`: Unit tests for memory tools functionality
  - `test_memory_integration.py`: Integration tests for the memory system
- `debug/`: Contains development tools and scripts for debugging/testing individual components

### Automated Testing

We use several mechanisms to ensure code quality:

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatically run tests before each commit
   - Located at `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
   - Currently runs all memory-related tests
   - Prevents commits if tests fail

2. **Manual Testing**: Run specific test suites
   ```bash
   # Run all memory tests
   python -m pytest tests/test_memory_*.py
   
   # Run specific test file
   python -m pytest tests/test_memory_tools.py
   
   # Run with verbose output
   python -m pytest tests/test_memory_*.py -v
   ```

## Setting Up Testing Environment

1. Install test hooks:
   ```bash
   ./install-hooks.sh
   ```

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

## Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions in isolation
  - Cover basic functionality
  - Use mocking for external dependencies
  - Verify expected behavior

- **Integration Tests**: Test multiple components working together
  - Verify end-to-end workflows
  - Test proper interaction between components

## Future Enhancements

- Add test coverage reports
- Set up continuous integration
- Add property-based tests for more comprehensive testing
- Create benchmarks for performance testing

## Guidelines for Adding Tests

When adding new features:

1. Write unit tests for individual functions
2. Write integration tests for component interactions
3. Run existing tests to ensure no regressions
4. Update documentation if testing approach changes
